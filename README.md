# airpods_extension
Extension for Apple AirPods for GNOME (>=3.14.1) on Linux.

Python scripts location should be ~ directory. Extension should be installed to  ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ directory.

Currently connect.py/disconnect.py script contains fake MAC address that need to be replaced with yours.

This is the first version and it need to be improved.
